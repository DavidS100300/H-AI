        <p>We decided to give our team the name H+AI. H+AI is pronounced as "hi." We wanted to make sure that our team name was approachable and easy to
                remember as our project idea entails fusing human resources with AI. We came up with the moniker H+AI. The name of our group makes it easy to
                start a conversation and to identify ourselves. It also appropriately identifies us as introverts because we are naturally reserved. </p>
        <h3>1.1. Santoso David</h3>
        <p>MMy name is Santoso David, my student ID is S3824107, and my email is s3824107@rmit.edu.vn. I am majoring in information technology (IT) at
                RMIT Vietnam. My dad is Taiwanese, and my mom is Indonesian. Although I can not speak Indonesian fluently, I can speak Mandarin and Taiwanese,
                because I went to Taipei International School from kindergarten all the way to high school. I had a huge interest in computers from a very young
                age. I decided I want to pursue my career towards IT during high school.They all have one thing in common: making a lot of money, having lots of
                spare time, and having the opportunity to travel for work. I started to wonder what kinds of employment in the future will have opportunities like
                this. When I developed my answer, I was a young person, and I had no notion of what set information technology apart from engineering. Fortunately,
                I was quite skilled with computers when I was a small child; all I know is that these works include computers. But during the first semester in
                RMIT University, I hit a few bumps during the courses, but I still put in my effort and the spirit of not giving up, hopefully I can pass the
                courses that I enrolled in.</p>
        <h3>1.2. Ho Van Khoa</h3>
        <p>My name is Ho Van Khoa (s3997024), and I attend RMIT University Vietnam where I study information technology (IT). Because of the impression that
                artificial intelligence (AI) gives us and how it has transformed our working and communication processes, my future minor would be artificial
                intelligence (AI) engineer. Additionally, I believe AI could help people access information and assimilate knowledge more quickly. I like to play
                first-person shooter (FPS) video games and listen to music as hobbies. Regarding my IT experience, I took part in a game development program run
                by my uncle's company, where I learned how to use the basics of coding to create several 2D games and gained experience working with other teens
                in a real workplace. In addition, I became interested in programming following this course and enrolled in a range of IT courses in high school,
                including basic HTML and simple Python.</p>
        <h3>1.3. Tran Minh Sang</h3>
        <p>My name is Tran Minh Sang, and I'm now enrolled at RMIT University to pursue a Business (Management) degree. My student email address is
                s3818464@rmit.edu.vn, and my student ID is s3818464. My personal email address is sangtran082201@gmail.com, so you can contact me there as well.
                I was born in Vietnam, and I have resided here ever since. The highest degree of schooling I've obtained is a high school diploma, which I received
                from Binh Long High School for the Gifted. I speak English, Japanese, and my native Vietnamese fluently, and I also have a basic grasp of French.
                I study for my current degree as well as a variety of additional courses, such as Information Technology, that are somehow related to my major.
                However, I also enjoy taking pictures, which I would consider to be a pastime. I hope to one day accomplish my dream of coding for my own business
                while lounging on a cruise ship and documenting the experience on my blog thanks to my expertise in business, IT, and photography.</p>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>3. Project Description</h2>
        <h3>3.1. Topic</h3>
        <p>The purpose of the project is to innovate a recruitment application utilizing the adaptation of Artificial Intelligence into traditional human
                resource practices, particularly for the hiring process. Specifically, the application will comprise a wide range of key core human resource
                features using artificial intelligence such as CV scanning, rating, skills assessment, etc. By automating these traditional activities, we would
                thrive to eliminate these time-consuming and manual tasks that were done using spreadsheets or simple structure, enhancing working process and
                bring about utmost efficiency. The primary objective is to bring about a cohesive and efficient working process for recruiters and candidates alike,
                streamlining their navigation through the recruitment process with ease.
            </p>
        <h3>3.2. Motivation</h3>
        <p>The motivation behind our project is to utilise AI technology within a business context to transform the recruitment process. The ultimate goal of
                our project is to improve hiring outcomes, reducing noteworthy working time and cost savings implementing task automation. The statement is in
                accordance with contemporary information technology patterns as it highlights our capacity to implement nascent technologies in a pragmatic manner,
                demonstrating knowledge in software engineering, data analytics, and user interface/user experience. Upon engaging in the project, we would be able
                to develop our proficiency in information technology, specifically artificial intelligence, as well as further soft skills in critical thinking,
                etc thereby presenting a persuasive argument to current business context regarding the utilisation of technology for consequential resolutions.
            </p>
        <h3>3.3. Landscape</h3>
        <p>Within the realm of recruitment systems and products, there exist numerous functioning solutions and competitors that incorporate artificial
                intelligence technology. Popular services include Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) such as Workday, Greenhouse, and Jobvite, which streamline
                recruitment processes. In addition, automated screening tools that utilize artificial intelligence, such as HireVue and Ideal, have been developed
                to speed up the initial assessment of resumes. AI-powered talent sourcing tools such as Entelo and HiringSolved are utilized for candidate
                identification, while technical capabilities are assessed through skills evaluation platforms like Codility and HackerRank. Our project stands out
                by combining these key features into a comprehensive AI-powered recruitment application that integrates automated resume screening, intelligent
                candidate sourcing, bias reduction measures, and data-driven decision-making. Our application's strength lies in its ability to provide holistic
                and end-to-end recruitment support, offering a unified platform that brings together multiple AI-driven features for enhanced efficiency, accuracy,
                and an improved candidate and recruiter experience.

<section id="4. DETAILED DESCRIPTION">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>4. Detailed Description</h2>
        <h3>4.1. Aims
</h2><p>The aim of this IT project is to revolutionize the recruitment process in businesses by maximizing the power of artificial intelligence (AI). For an
                easy term, we planned to program our AI system to stimulate thinking and reasoning of a recruiter. Our goal is to create a recruitment system that
                can transform the way businesses find, evaluate, and hire candidates. We also aim to design a system that can enhance the performance of businesses
                by finding the best talent available in the competitive labor market. Compared to the old and traditional recruitment methods which are more
                inefficient, biased by the recruiter and time-consuming because it has to go through many processes. The new recruitment process which applies AI
                technologies designed to handle large amounts of different sets of data including resumes, past performance, KPIs, etc. As a result, it give
                businesses the best insights and recommendations to identify the most qualified candidates which will significantly improve the recruitment result
                and enhance candidate selection by using machine learning and take advantages of the development of the advanced algorithm.
            </p>
<h4>GOAL 1: Having better outcomes in workforce</h4>
<p>Our first goal in this project is to find the most suitable employees that have the same purposes and the goals with a business in order to
                establish a strong sense of commitment and help them develop in the internal/international market with a cohesive and successful workforce. By using
                AI technologies into our new recruitment system, they can give businesses insights and recommendations to select the best and suitable employee for 
                the company by screening their resume and have suitable questions in the interview. This will ensure that the new recruitment process system is
                focused and relevant by providing valuable recommendations for evaluating candidates for the jobs and departments they are in. Together, humans and AI
                can operate productively and effectively.
            </p>
<h4>GOAL 2: Creating multicultural working environment</h4>
<p>Our second goal to create this project is to develop a multicultural working environment with the best performance from different employees with
                diverse backgrounds. As we mentioned in the first goal, our AI system can find workers all over the world.  Thus, it is easier for businesses to
                find the employee has the suitable abilities for their business due to larger labor resources. Thus, they can create a diverse working environment
                for workers to compete and develop themselves.The reason for this is the more competitive the jobs are, the higher efficiency and the better
                outcomes a business can have leads to better position in the market and gain more competitive advantage. 
            </p>
<h4>GOAL 3: Reduce significant time and cost of the traditional recruitment process</h4>
<p>Our third goal in this project is to fasten and revolutionize the traditional recruitment process which will involve automating tasks such as
                evaluating resumes, analyzing past performance and scheduling interviews. As evaluating tasks are completed by AI, recruiters will have a large
                amount of time to select candidates requiring complex and deep thinking that AI cannot perform. The system can also provide insights and feedback
                to both recruiters and applicants, and help recruiters make better decisions based on data and analytics.

                Therefore, businesses using our AI system not only can reduce time and cost of the long recruitment process but also improve the experience from both
                sides of the recruitment: the HR department and the candidates.If things don't go as expected, the most important parts of the project would be
                evaluated to determine priorities and fallback options and these order will be:
            </p>
<p>Goal 1: Better outcomes for the workforce. Establishing a strong and committed workforce that aligns with the companys purposes and goals forms the foundation for success in internal/international markets.
            </p>
<p>Goal 2: multiculturalism can be considered as the next priority, as it contributes to long-term growth and competitiveness by creating more competitive and efficient working environments. 
            </p>
<p>Goal 3: Reduce time and cost of the traditional recruitment process can be adjusted if necessary because in the development phase of this system, it requires a lot of money and time. However, cost and time efficiency will be considered when this new recruitment system running smoothly
            </p>
<h3>4.2. Plans And Progress</h3>
<h4>Forming a Group</h4>
<p>We weren't particularly successful in the recruiting stage; we had intended for one of our members—David's friend—to join
                the group project. However, he was not in the same class as us. Tuan was the member that the professor assigned to us. 
                Sadly, he was involved in an accident and could not stay with us for very long. We initially had trouble coming up with
                a concept because there are countless possibilities given the technology of today. We had a number of ideas for what we
                could build in order to better society and humanity, like a relaxation app and a daily calorie counter app. Following a
                discussion among the team members, we chose to implement Sang's suggestion for an AI that focuses mostly on human resources.
            </p>
<h4>Summarising our Ideas</h4>
<p>We were trying to avoid making the app different from the job-finding software that we already had when we first tried
                to think of features for it. After a few discussions, we decided that we had placed too much emphasis on the interactions
                between employees and users. Our goal is to become an automatic candidate-finding headhunter firm for the business. When
                looking for new employees, we questioned some human resources from other businesses on the most crucial quality a candidate
                hould possess. Despite the fact that each of them provided a different response, they all shared a passion for learning.
                All the businesses we spoke with agreed that personalities and honesty are the most crucial factors. Even several of the
                businesses we spoke with highlighted how crucial it is for employees to feel comfortable working together. Making the things
                they mentioned into data that our AI can use is quite tough. Thus, we made the decision to concentrate on the strategies
                that will benefit both companies and employees the most. 
            </p>
<h4>Different Features for Companies and Candidates</h4>
<p>Setting up interviews was the first action we took. We created a portal where businesses can schedule a certain time
               for interviews and candidates can choose when to show up. The employers save a ton of time by not having to call every
                applicant to schedule a meeting. Additionally, candidates are free to select a time that works for them. The next feature
                we implemented for businesses is auto-extract the data they require. By just snapping a photo of their resume, prospects
                can post it. 
            </p>
<p>We set up a system for the candidates to upload their resumes that will automatically highlight their strongest skills.
                They can use AI to help them emphasise their assets after taking a picture of their resume. It can inform employers of the
                candidates' capabilities. We also provided ratings for the candidates. In essence, this tool allows former coworkers and
                employers to remark on the kind of teammates they would recommend and how it would be to have you on staff.
            </p>
<p>The last function we offered was automatic email sending, which was available to both employers and candidates.
                Companies, for instance, are notified through email whenever new applicants are submitted, and applicants are notified
                when an interview request is approved by the company for which they are applying. The human resources division of
                businesses would benefit greatly from the time and resources saved by doing this. We can also utilise this information
                to inform businesses that are having trouble hiring why the majority of candidates do not submit applications to them
                and what they could do differently in the future. For their candidates, companies can also upload an email format. 
            </p>
<h4>Aims for the Future</h4>
<p>After a few encounters, we first want to work for a single company. We made the decision to think creatively.
                Because our initial goal was to facilitate society, our product will resemble an application that anyone can make
                available for usage by anyone. Things are challenging for both companies and employees two years after the outbreak.
                Finding employees who are a good fit for an employer may be challenging and time- and money-consuming during the hiring
                process. Some businesses spent a headhunter firm several million dollars only to find the right individual. And since
                there are many new businesses as a result of the pandemic, finding personnel for them can be challenging. They spent
                a lot of money simply to promote their business. So we decided to make it user-friendly for everyone who needs it. 
            </p>
<h4>Important information</h4>
<p>At this time, our project does not require any fancy features. We concentrated on how to best serve both end users.
                If you are a brand-new participant in our project. The user experience and user interface should be your primary areas
                of attention. The most crucial thing is to communicate with the businesses we worked for and be aware of their needs
                and wants. The next thing you should research is what the current employment trends are. We must keep up with the trend
                as it changes every year along with the needs. In the future, if at all possible, consider integrating more cutting-edge
                features. Using AI to assist candidates in creating their own unique webpage is one example. Use AI more to finish your
                jobs since human resources are primarily used for human tasks.

<h3>4.3. Scopes and Limits</h3>
<h4>Scopes</h4>
<p>This project focuses on implementing AI technology to revolutionize the recruitment process in businesses. In our first draft (first idea),
                we planned to integrate AI systems in various stages of the recruitment process including screening, analyzing performance, interview, etc.
                Machine learning and deep learning will be necessary in the development phase because they can help us to extract higher-level features of data and
                we all have enough knowledge to use and develop them. However, due to time and technology limitations, we can not use AI to interview candidates 
                because they can not generate emotions and empathize with human feelings and it will be against ethics. Despite the fact that it can analyze
                resumes and application forms, it can not analyze personality, motivation of a person. Therefore, we decided to use this AI system as a tool and
                businesses should rely on human’s decisions in the recruitment process. We also trained our system into different sets of ethical and moral rules
                in order to possibly avoid bias and provide the appropriate analysis. As a result, this system will have the including features:
            </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Scan resume of candidates</li>
  <li>Analyze past performance/stats and give a full report to businesses</li>
  <li>Provide rating of a candidates</li>
  <li>Automate send email to candidate</li>
  <li>Automate schedule interview for candidates and recruiters</li>
</ul>
<h4>Limitations</h4>
<p>There are certain limits that AI engineers and businesses need to consider despite this is the project using AI to enhance the recruitment process.
                Firstly, the insights and recommendations that this system provides will heavily depend on the quality and the relevance of data that AI engineers
                trained it on. Secondly, because each recruiter will have a different mindset and criteria to select the appropriate candidates, it will be
                difficult for AI engineers to observe and analyze this enormous and diverse data. Thirdly, AI is not human, it can not have enough intelligence to
                create different kinds of emotions due to the limitations of technology. Therefore, a business can not replace the needs of humans by using this AI
                system to interview people. Lastly, this system will only assist the Human Resource Management department in a business in screening and evaluating
                candidates based on their past performance and stats. Furthermore, it will not account for different major factors in a working environment that
                significantly affect the suitability and the effectiveness of an employee in a specific role or department. As a result, it can not define how well
                they adapt into the business working environment and how effectively they communicate with others colleagues. Therefore, this system is only a tool
                that supports the HR department to fasten the process of recruitment rather than a replacement system for human decision-making which are
                stakeholders and shareholders.
            </p>
<h3>4.5. Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>In order to improve the user experience and user interface (UI/UX), we would use web design-related technologies, such as Java, HTML, etc.
                Additionally, front-end and back-end technology tools should be used to achieve the goal of efficiency, which definitely will assist our
                customers (businesses and recruiters). The following are some language suggestions for back-end website development: Python, Django, Ruby,
                Node.js, etc.
            </p>
<p>For text analyzing, natural language processing libraries such as NLTK, SpaCy, or Stanford NLP are needed. The application of machine learning and
                deep learning is also a major part that we should focus on as we utilize the power of artificial intelligence in the human resource industry.
                Additionally, machine learning frameworks will be needed for training machine learning models for tasks such as candidate selecting, resume
                screening, or interview analysis. TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn are the best tools on the market for developing AI systems, according to
                several AI engineers and programmers. In particular, scikit-learn, which was constructed using NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib, gives users a quick,
                easy, and effective tool for analyzing and comparing various data sets. 
            </p>
<p>All of the softwares and tools mentioned above, we will use the stable version in order to avoid any bugs and errors in our system. Regarding
                software licenses, the specific requirements may different based on the different tools and libraries. However, we will avoid any conflict and
                inappropriate acts relating to licensing issues by registering if needed.
            </p>
<p>In terms of hardware, besides a standard laptop or similar device, there are no specific hardware requirements for the AI recruitment system.
                However, on a large scale of the project which required lots of computational training and learning, we demand additional hardware resources such
                as GPUs or cloud-based infrastructure might be necessary to improve performance because our system needs to store a different high-level feature of
                data from application forms, resumes, and performance/stats of candidates.
            </p>
<p>As for prior experience with the tools and technologies, it is definitely advantageous for businesses and the project to have team members in the
                technical department to have experience with natural language process libraries, machine learning frameworks and database management systems.
                Furthermore, we demand for employees who work in AI fields such as natural language processing and especially machine learning and deep learning.
                Specifically, we required a bachelor's or master's degree in computer science or information technology and working experience with these programs
                for at least 2 years.
            </p>
<h3>4.6. Testings</h3>
<p>Testing is one of the crucial steps needed to develop the project. A project is continuously tested throughout its development period, and the
                future development of new features requires the testing to be a coherent process. The first step in our process involves performing user acceptance
                testing (UAT) with a select cohort of recruiters and HR professionals. The purpose of this exercise is to verify the application's functionality,
                usability, and overall user experience. The initial phase of testing will yield significant insights and feedback, facilitating the implementation
                of requisite modifications and the validation of our product development. Furthermore, we will conduct ongoing integration testing during the
                development phase to verify the appropriate operation of individual elements and their smooth integration. The process will entail conducting
                thorough unit testing, integration testing, and system testing in order to detect and address any potential bugs, problems, or discrepancies.
                The evaluation of the efficacy of our AI algorithms will be conducted through the measurement of their accuracy, bias mitigation capabilities, and
                impact on recruitment outcomes. Having able to achieve the aforementioned goals is a stepping stone for our project to develop cohesive features
                and improve working efficiency. These benchmarks encompass precise resume screening, enhanced candidate selection, favorable user reviews,
                heightened efficacy in the recruitment procedure, and congruence with established organizational objectives. However, in order for the testing of
                the project to be objectively completed, a participation from HR specialist is needed to give a more thoughtful opinions and feedbacks for us to
                deliver better features. The appropriate quantity of test users is contingent upon the project's scope; however, we envisage collaborating with a
                representative sample size to acquire significant insights and authenticate the application's efficacy. 
            </p>
<h3>4.7. Timeframe</h3>
<p>In order to sufficiently allocate the tasks and work for the development of the project, a thorough communication/collaboration with our team
                members need to be coherent and fair for everyone to contribute. Thus, we have developed a timeframe consisting of 16 week of development, the
                task will parallel with the week consecutively: 
            </p>

</ul>        

            
<h3>4.8. Risks</h3>
<p>As you know, AI is a very powerful system that can bring numerous benefits to businesses and HR departments. There are still some potential risks
                and ethical issues related to this tool. By proactively approaching these risks and implementing appropriate solutions, businesses can enhance the
                system while minimizing potential drawbacks.Here are some key risks to consider:
            </p>
<p>Firstly, new employees may not perform as effectively as their previous jobs. The reason for this is because real performance is based on the 
                adaptation of employees on different sets of backgrounds and environments while the old historical data and resumes that AI learn only show the
                performance of candidates on the previous job. Additionally, each person possesses unique personalities and characteristics that can influence
                their performance in a new role.
            </p>
<p>Secondly, security issues and privacy issues are also big challenges for businesses. This is because our AI system requires different kinds of data
                including resumes, application forms, and even some sensitive personal data such as behaviors, personality characteristics, biometric information
                (race, face recognition fingerprint, etc). As a result, this will raise some data security concerns for users (candidates and recruiters) and
                businesses.
            </p>
<p>Thirdly, despite the fact that the use of our AI system is to avoid bias in recruiters, recruitment processes using AI may also encounter some bias.
                The reason for this is AI systems need to train from a wide range of statistics and actual data and these may be biased or reflect existing societal
                prejudices.
            </p>
<p>Lasly, by utilizing almost everything using the AI system, it may cause a negative impact on a candidate's experience by reducing human interaction.
                Many people with less skills and abilities than the rest will be frustrated because their jobs completely depend on AI and this may cause a negative
                impact on society by creating more unemployment because companies will prefer better employees. This will raise enormous ethical problems.

    <section id="6. GROUP REFLECTION">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>6. Group Reflection</h2>
            <p>At the end of the assignment, our group performed a thorough analysis of the project. The tasks at hand have been distributed evenly and efficiently,
                contributing to a smooth working flow and ensuring the outcome of the project is achieved. Additionally, our team has communicated effectively and
                maintained open and clear verbal interactions with each other, altogether creating a thoughtful collaboration of teamwork. 
            </p>
            <p>However, there are still some things that we could improve on in order to achieve a better result for our project. Firstly, we should reconsider
                more about the time for each task that was done, as we have challenges in distributing the time to be more efficient toward the end of the
                assignment. Additionally, we were having some arguments at some point in the assignment, in which each of the members had a different point of
                view on the project. What we should have done better was to resolve the conflict and become rather active listeners,  seeking a common ground for
                everyone. Thus, this has become a vital lesson for us to learn for the future prospects of the program. 
            </p>
            <p>One thing that was surprising to us was how creative each of us can be. Through collaboration and brainstorming, all of the members have showcased
                unexpected ideas and their point of view on the project, bringing unique insights to the table and leading to innovative solutions that may not
                have been initially considered. 
            </p>
            <p>Ultimately, one thing that we have learned about groups is that they are able to bring about a highly productive and efficient working process
                if we are able to develop a clear and thorough sense of our project’s purpose and benefit. Having effective leadership can also help us navigate
                through the assignment’s hard task. Nevertheless, our team leader has proven to be a worthy and successful leader, contributing his knowledge to us
                effectively and thoroughly. Additionally, he was an active listener, combining this with a shared understanding of goals and expectations.
                However, groups can also face challenges and hard work in terms of coordination and decision-making. Thus, an understanding of the dynamics and
                complexities of groups is crucial for our own well-being as well as that of the group as a whole.
